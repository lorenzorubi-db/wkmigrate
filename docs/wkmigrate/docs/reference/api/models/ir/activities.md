This module defines internal representations for pipeline activities.

Activities in this module represent the core components of a pipeline. Each activity contains 
metadata about the activity's type, name, and parameters. Activities are translated from ADF 
payloads into internal representations that can be used to generate Databricks Lakeflow jobs.

## Activity Objects

```python
@dataclass
class Activity()
```

Base class for translated pipeline activities.

**Attributes**:

- `name` - Logical name of the activity as defined in ADF.
- `task_key` - Unique identifier used to reference this task within a workflow.
- `activity_type` - Original ADF activity type string (for example ``DatabricksNotebook``).
- `description` - Free-form description of what the activity does.
- `timeout_seconds` - Maximum allowed execution time in seconds before the task is cancelled.
- `max_retries` - Maximum number of retry attempts on failure.
- `min_retry_interval_millis` - Minimum delay between retry attempts in milliseconds.
- `depends_on` - List of upstream task dependencies that must complete before this task runs.
- `new_cluster` - Cluster configuration dictionary for tasks that provision a new cluster.

## DatabricksNotebookActivity Objects

```python
@dataclass
class DatabricksNotebookActivity(Activity)
```

Databricks notebook activity metadata.

**Attributes**:

- `notebook_path` - Workspace path to the Databricks notebook to execute.
- `base_parameters` - Mapping of parameter names to default values passed to the notebook.
- `linked_service_definition` - Raw ADF linked-service dictionary used to configure the cluster.

## CopyActivity Objects

```python
@dataclass
class CopyActivity(Activity)
```

Copy activity metadata including datasets and mappings.

**Attributes**:

- `source_dataset` - Parsed IR representation of the source dataset.
- `sink_dataset` - Parsed IR representation of the sink dataset.
- `source_properties` - Parsed dataset properties associated with the source.
- `sink_properties` - Parsed dataset properties associated with the sink.
- `column_mapping` - Column-level mappings from source to sink, if provided.

## ForEachActivity Objects

```python
@dataclass
class ForEachActivity(Activity)
```

ForEach activity metadata including inner activities.

**Attributes**:

- `items_string` - Serialized iterable expression that drives the loop.
- `inner_activities` - List of activities to execute for each item.
- `concurrency` - Maximum number of loop iterations to run in parallel.

## SparkJarActivity Objects

```python
@dataclass
class SparkJarActivity(Activity)
```

Spark JAR activity metadata.

**Attributes**:

- `main_class_name` - Fully qualified main class to invoke within the JAR.
- `parameters` - List of string arguments passed to the main class.
- `libraries` - Additional library descriptors attached to the task.

## SparkPythonActivity Objects

```python
@dataclass
class SparkPythonActivity(Activity)
```

Spark Python activity metadata.

**Attributes**:

- `python_file` - Path to the Python file or wheel to execute.
- `parameters` - List of string arguments passed to the Python entry point.

## IfConditionActivity Objects

```python
@dataclass
class IfConditionActivity(Activity)
```

If Condition activity metadata.

**Attributes**:

- `op` - Name of the comparison operator derived from the ADF expression.
- `left` - Left-hand operand used in the conditional expression.
- `right` - Right-hand operand used in the conditional expression.
- `child_activities` - Activities that form the body of the conditional branch.

## ColumnMapping Objects

```python
@dataclass
class ColumnMapping()
```

Represents a column-level mapping between datasets.

**Attributes**:

- `source_column_name` - Column name or ordinal-derived alias in the source dataset.
- `sink_column_name` - Column name in the sink dataset that receives the value.
- `sink_column_type` - Target column data type, if available.

## Dependency Objects

```python
@dataclass
class Dependency()
```

Represents a dependency on another task.

**Attributes**:

- `task_key` - Task key of the upstream activity this task depends on.
- `outcome` - Required outcome of the upstream task (for example ``Succeeded``) for this dependency.
