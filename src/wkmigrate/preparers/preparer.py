"""
This module defines a preparer for creating Databricks Lakeflow jobs from an ADF
pipeline which has been translated with wkmigrate.

The preparer builds Databricks Lakeflow jobs tasks and associated artifacts needed
to replicate the pipeline's functionality. This includes job settings, task definitions,
notebooks, pipelines, and secrets to be created in the target workspace.
